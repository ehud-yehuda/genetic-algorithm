# genetic-algorithm
Gentic Algorithm Implemetation. 
reconstructing image(even RGB one) using GA.

Please for explanation about the algorithm and the code structure, look on the PDF file.

requirments:
- python 3.6
- numpy
- Pillow
- scipy

In order to activate the main function, Please make sure the refernce image is in the same directory like the code name: 'target'
The target image must be a RGB one.

The Code will open a new directory name: 'results' and will print images every 6 iterations.
And a log file
